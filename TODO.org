* Add alarm status to display - DONE
Will require changing display_time_* funcs

* Make alarm display blink - DONE
Will require making display_alarm_* funcs

* Refactor main loop to sleep in intervals smaller than 1 sec - DONE
This will make user input snappier, but will require altering how time is incremented

* Enable user to set time and alarm time - DONE
Will require some complex additions
Did by adding display_setting_buffer() and adding new key commands (s, S, d, D, i, I, f) in main()

* Enable user to turn entire clock on/off - DONE
Will require some simple refactoring of main()

* Improve the look of the displayed time
Will require changing the display_* funcs

* Find an alternative to A_BLINK for displaying the triggered alarm
Will require changing display_alarm()
** Reason: A_BLINK seems to work in some terminals and not others
Worked for me in Wezterm and not in Alacritty

* Improve clarity with how information (snooze status, set buffers) is displayed
Will require some changes to display_* funcs
